[WP] Instead of trying to get a man on the moon, every nation raced to be the first at the very bottom of the ocean

"While we have managed to get to space and the moon we have not fully explored the ocean. Instead of the space race, there was a competition to see who could reach the very bottom."

There is no color here. Your flag is just another shred of tattered blackness, your hull, invisible. In this drowning midnight, all are equal in their blindness and in their invisibility. Here, only strength and the ability to withstand the battering of time and pressure matter. Looking through the porthole, you wouldn't be able to spot a levianthan if you tried - and by God above, the Leviathans are real. We made them, the great hulking beasts, metal monstrosities in the hidden deep, filled with life, though not living. The leviathans are abyssopelagic cities unto themselves, possessing hydroponic farms, medical wards, and gigantic dormitory buildings, eliminating the need to return to the surface. With the ability to process oxygen, freshwater, and salt from ocean water, there are men below who, for years, have not surfaced to anything higher than the depths of twilight, let alone seen sunlight. 

Each Leviathan-class subsea station displaces 560 kilotons and can hold a complement of 1,250 men. While technically mobile, their top speed while submerged is only 3 knots. The vast majority of Leviathans have never been moved after hitting target depth, and are permanently anchored into the seabed. The oldest Leviathan, the Russian *VB-01*, has been anchored for seven years now. Playing their part in a mirror to a story almost a century old, the Americans quickly followed.
